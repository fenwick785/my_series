Every episode is just a few scenes of what a couple would do on a daily basis, such as shopping, watching TV, going for coffee, visiting friends, driving in car, going to the movies etc... The weird thing about it, is that the camera is ALWAYS put in a way, so as ONLY the main two actors (Dimitra & Thodoris) are shown. The other actors (friends, relatives, strangers) DO play a role, and DO speak, but we just don't see their faces, we only see their hands or their feet! It is indeed strange, but it wants to emphasize on the COUPLE and their feelings and reactions. Every word exchanged between Dimitra and Thodoris, every sentence, is so funny and sincere at the same time, and the whole image of them would be the most realistic picture of a Greek couple. The most important thing, is that you NEVER get bored. The screen is build upon very short dialogues, conversations, which are very typical of a Greek couple, but of course, there is some repetition of specific phrases, so that the couple has some \"character\". For instance, Dimitra wonders from the very first episode \"When will I become a mother?\", and is always whining to Thodoris, trying to convince him to have a baby!

What Schama does do, however, is tell the story in vivid and gripping narrative terms, free of the fustiness of traditional academe, personalising key historical events by examining the major characters at the centre of them. Not all historians would approve of the history depicted here as shaped principally by the actions of great men and women rather than by more abstract developments, but Schama's way of telling it is a good deal more enthralling as a result. \nSchama successfully gives lie to the idea that the history of Britain has been moderate and temperate, passing down the generations as stately as a galleon, taking on board sensible ideas but steering clear of sillier, revolutionary ones. Nonsense. Schama retells British history the way it was--as bloody, convulsive, precarious, hot-blooded and several times within an inch of haring off onto an entirely different course. Schama seems almost to delight in the goriness of history. Themes returned to repeatedly include the wars between the Scots and the Irish and the Catholic\/Protestant conflicts--only the Irish question remains unresolved by the new millennium. As Britain becomes a constitutional monarchy, Schama talks less of Kings and Queens but of poets and idea-makers like Orwell. Still, with his pungent, direct manner and against an evocative visual and aural backdrop, Schama makes history seem as though it happened yesterday, the bloodstains not yet dry.","length":"55","seasons":"3","seasons_details":[{"number":1,"episodes":11},{"number":2,"episodes":4},{"number":3,"episodes":4}],"episodes":"19","creation":"2000","genres":["Documentaire"],"language":"en","images":{"show":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/show\/2591_1246314.jpg","banner":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/banner\/2591_33657.jpg","box":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/box\/2591_33657.jpg","poster":null}},{"id":2692,"status":"Ended","title":"A History of Christianity","description":"Professor Diarmaid MacCulloch - one of the world's leading historians - reveals the origins of Christianity and explores what it means to be a Christian.","length":"60","seasons":"1","seasons_details":[{"number":1,"episodes":6}],"episodes":"6","creation":"2009","genres":["Documentaire"],"language":"en","images":{"show":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/show\/2692_1439149283.jpg","banner":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/banner\/2692_304261.jpg","box":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/box\/2692_304261.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/poster\/124861.jpg"}},{"id":2882,"status":"Ended","title":"A History of Horror with Mark Gatiss","description":"Three-part series in which actor and writer Mark Gatiss celebrates the greatest achievements of horror cinema.","length":"60","seasons":"1","seasons_details":[{"number":1,"episodes":4}],"episodes":"4","creation":"2010","genres":["Documentaire","Int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier"],"language":"en","images":{"show":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/show\/2882_930538.jpg","banner":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/banner\/2882_659641.jpg","box":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/box\/2882_659641.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/poster\/197081.jpg"}},{"id":8427,"status":"Ended","title":"A History of Modern Britain","description":"Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain is a 2007 BBC documentary television series presented by Andrew Marr that covers the period of British history from the end of the Second World War onwards.

Joining in this covert operation is American president Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, risking possible impeachment, encourages Sir William to establish a training base for spies in Ontario. Other concerned parties include the courageous French expatriate Madelaine (Barbara Hershey) and Sir William's right-hand man Evan Michaelain (Michael York). Location-filmed in England, Norway, and Canada, A Man Called Intrepid was originally broadcast from May 20 to 22, 1979.

It was made by Associated-Rediffusion and broadcast only in London area. It was 25 minutes plus adverts.\n\nIt was predominantly a sketch comedy attempting to translate the audio antics of the The Goon Show into visual antics in bizarre and often surreal comedy sketches which just suddenly ended with a new sketch beginning. Many performers played small parts in the shows like Ernest Clark, Jon Jon Keefe, Patricia Driscoll, etc. Famous people of the day like Hans and Lotte Hass were parodied. Canadian star, Patti Lewis had a singing spot about the middle of the show, and Max Geldray a music spot later on. There were few taboos with sketches showing people in various states of undress, cameramen, behind the scenes workers and the studios. The Ying Tong song was sung for no apparent reason at various times.\n\nThe series was written by Spike Milligan and produced and directed by Richard Lester.\n\nIt was followed by Son of Fred later in 1956.\n\nA half hour special Best of Fred was broadcast on 18 September 1963 combining surviving sketches from A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred.","length":"30","seasons":"1","seasons_details":[{"number":1,"episodes":5}],"episodes":"5","creation":"1956","genres":["Com\u00e9die"],"language":"en","images":{"show":"https:\/\/pictures.betaseries.com\/fonds\/show\/2556_1238703.jpg","banner":null,"box":null,"poster":null}},{"id":16560,"status":"Ended","title":"A Sister's All You Need","description":"Nous suivons le quotidien de Hashima Itsuki, nouvelliste atteint d\u2019une obsession maladive pour les petites s\u0153urs, mais qui n\u2019a qu\u2019un petit fr\u00e8re par alliance, Chihiro .

During one investigation, his assistant police dog sacrificed its life to save him. Struck by the death, Sing decided to join the Police Dog Unit. In 25 years, he advanced from a dog caretaker to an instructor and he now plans to use his retirement money to open a dog care center, allowing dog owners to bring their dogs for training and play.\n\nSing's wife died a long time ago, but left him with an obedient daughter, Lai Sin Yue (Linda Chung). Yue follows after her father and loves animals as if they were human. This eventually leads Yue to become a veterinarian. She later decides to help her dad and moves to the countryside to help with his dog care center. Her determination is driven by the fact that she wants to make sure all animals are treated lovingly.\n\nIn the countryside, they soon meet the rowdy bunch that lives there. Chow Yung Kung (Steven Ma) is the renovator who is in charge of preparing the dog care center. Yue and Kung initially start off on the wrong foot, but the two eventually start developing feelings for each other as they spend more time together. They start to fall in love with each other, but Sing refuses to accept Kung as his daughter's boyfriend, saying that Kung has no education, no stable job, and on top of that, is perverted. To make things more complicated, Kung's ex-girlfriend (Queenie Chu) reappears with a vengeance.\n\nThe two side stories involve Chiang Tin-Ngo (Maggie Siu), her brother Tin-Hung (Lee Kwok Lun), Chou Ka-Man (Natalie Tong), and Ho Tin-Yau (Raymond Wong). Tin-Hung has always been looked down upon by his father and sister as a failure. He wants to start his own business, but his father will not loan him the money, believing all of his son's ideas are bound to end up a disaster. His sister refuses to help him plead their father, so Tin-Hung resorts to kidnapping Tin-Ngo and demanding their father for a large sum of money.\n\nTin-Ngo then devotes herself to finding the kidnapper, believing it is someone in the nearby countryside. She monitors all of villagers closely, looking for something suspicious. She even decides to move in to study them closer.
